# LetterBoxingADV
LetterBoxing advanced

The aim of this extention is to provide a temorary fix to [Firefox's letterboxing vulnerability](https://github.com/a7maadf/Bypass-LetterBoxing "Firefox's letterboxing vulnerability") (which exists in tor too). 
The way the extention works is it scans webpages for potential "fullscreen" requests and if found will warn the user about it.
